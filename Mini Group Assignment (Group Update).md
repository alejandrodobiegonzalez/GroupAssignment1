## Linking Density and Affordability in Atwater Village and Leimert Park
_Alejandro Gonzalez and Michael Van Gorder, UP206_

#### [Project Markdown](https://github.com/alejandrodobiegonzalez/GroupAssignment1/tree/main/Group%20Assignments)

#### Roles: 

* Mike, _*The "Social Explorer"*_: Mike is generating maps and data in Social Explorer and he has chosen the title of “Social Explorer”.

* Alejandro, _*The BTS Designer*_: Alejandro is leading the design process and is laying out the data that is gathered by the team. 

#### Status update:

* Mood is grim, due more to external factors than anything else. Given our drastic switch in focus, we have many datasets to analyze. 
* Our group started on a larger scale and after various conversations and experimentations with data, we have seen the benefits of reducing our project scope to focus on two neighborhoods with different demographics and histories that are both within the City of Los Angeles.
  * **Atwater Village** is a predominantly white neighborhood along the commercial corridor on Glendale Blvd with pockets of working class Latinx populations nearest the LA River in the surrounding communities. Home valuations (modestly sized SFHs on large lots allowing for ADUs to be built) have shot up and have exceeded a million dollars. Zoning changes here may only sanction previously built ADUs; the NIMBYism here can be very strong. It’s Northeast Los Angeles running up into Glendale and the equestrian district. No significant historical black presence.
  * **Leimert Park** is a historically black working class Single-Family Neighborhood in South Los Angeles with two census block groups of plurality-Latinx. Given recent infrastructure investment in public transportation, many home values have also increased and the stability of the neighborhood has come into question. This nrighborhood makes a good case study to understand how the community is densifying and whether Black residents are able to remain in the community. 


#### Data update:

* Have not yet crunched the data for Leimert Park on Social Explorer. Overall, we started the project being interested in which single family neighborhoods were getting upzoned and why; yet using Social Explorer necessarily ties us to census data which has not been updated to the major statewide changes to reflect updates in ADU policy that rolled out this year. We can perhaps file this under ‘concerns’, but the past 18 months were when most of the density legislation moved forward to address our housing affordability crisis and we are instead relegated to comparing 2013 five-year ACS figures to 2018 five year ACS figures. We will continue to use [Social Explorer](https://data.census.gov/cedsci/table?g=0400000US06_1600000US0644000&d=ACS%205-Year%20Estimates%20Data%20Profiles&tid=ACSDP5Y2018.DP04) to specifically target Census Data that uncovers housing information in two distict neighborhoods. 

* Given our updated approach to move away from Unincorporated Riverside County to two neighborhoods in the City of Los Angeles, we are able to utilize LA City Data to compare growth in these two neighborhoods. Given this shift, we are now able to utilize permit data from the City [New Residential Building Permits](https://data.lacity.org/A-Prosperous-City/New-Residential-Building-Permits-over-100k/peyn-q7x3) to provide information on recent permit construction to supplement our census data that may be delayed. 

#### Concerns:

**Major Concerns:** 

1. Our initial goal was to study zoning issues that are extremely contemporaneous and are therefore unrepresented on Social Explorer. If there are other data that can rival the extremely digestible social explorer we’d love to see it, but in all likelihood we need to adjust our interests to comparing earlier in this decade to somewhat recently in this decade. 
2. Adjusting our target to two neighborhoods limits the kinds of stories we can tell, though it makes it more digestible. These two areas are pretty different and should manifest zoning changes distinctly. 
3. Neither area seems to be ‘upzoning’ so much as just adding ADUs; Atwater seems to have shed some multifamily units, and from personal experience I can vouch for the new multifamily units being all luxury buildings. 


**Minor Concerns:**

1. GIS is still really hard. 
2. America might end? I dunno, it’s a difficult time to focus on schoolwork.

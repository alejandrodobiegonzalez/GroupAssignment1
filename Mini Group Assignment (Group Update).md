## Linking Density and Affordability in Atwater Village and Leimert Park
_Alejandro Gonzalez and Michael Van Gorder, UP206_

#### [Project Markdown](https://github.com/alejandrodobiegonzalez/GroupAssignment1/tree/main/Group%20Assignments)

#### Roles: 

* Mike, _*The "Social Explorer"*_: Mike is generating maps and data in Social Explorer and he has chosen the title of “Social Explorer”.

* Alejandro, _*The BTS Designer*_: Alejandro is leading the design process and is laying out the data that is gathered by the group. 

#### Status update:

Mood is grim, due more to external factors than anything else.
Started on a larger scale and saw the benefits of reducing our project scope to focus on two neighborhoods with different demographics and histories. 

#### Data update: Provide a short narrative on where you are with the data sources you will incorporate in your project. Provide links as necessary.

#### Concerns: There should be a lot to be concerned about at this phase of the project. List those concerns and classify them as "Major concerns" and/or "Minor concerns."

* *Major Concerns:* 

1. Our initial goal was to study zoning issues that are extremely contemporaneous and are therefore unrepresented on Social explorer. If there are other data that can rival the extremely digestible social explorer we’d love to see it, but in all likelihood we need to adjust our interests to comparing earlier in this decade to somewhat recently in this decade. 

2. Adjusting our target to two neighborhoods limits the kinds of stories we can tell, though it makes it more digestible. These two areas are pretty different and should manifest zoning changes distinctly. 

3. Neither area seems to be ‘upzoning’ so much as just adding ADUs; Atwater seems to have shed some multifamily units, and from personal experience I can vouch for the new multifamily units being all luxury buildings. 


* Minor Concerns:

1. GIS is still really hard. 
2. America might end? I dunno, it’s a difficult time to focus on schoolwork.

# Exploring Density in Two Single Family Neighborhoods in Los Angeles: Atwater Village & Leimert Park 
_Alejandro Gonzalez and Michael Van Gorder, UP206_
## Research Question Introduction: Local and Historical Context of Single Family Housing Dominance

_Single family housing was historically elevated as the ‘Highest and Best Use’ of land in the United States, and exclusionary zoning served to artificially inflate property values for decades and suppress density in areas with elevating housing pressure, often with a racialized impact. The contemporary moment of single family housing in urban areas and their suburban rings is one of intense need for higher densities, and exclusionary zoning is being called into question - though not universally._ 

_Our initial interest was in how single family zoning has changed (or not changed) over time, where the changes to SFZ actually occurs (and doesn’t occur), and how the scarcity of zones that allow for density has contributed to the current housing affordability crisis in California. We have narrowed our study to two neighborhoods in Los Angeles County - Atwater Village in Northeast Los Angeles and Leimert Park in South Los Angeles._

_Grounding our research in the historical context of redlining practices in Los Angeles, we will explore how redlining has affected the growth of two single family neighborhoods -- Leimert Park and Atwater Village. Comparing housing data from the American community Survery (Social Explorer) and Los Angeles Department of Building and Safety (LADBS) construction permit data -- we are interested in what can be learned about the motivations for housing density in communities that are predominantly zoned for single family housing. Also, given the level of public investment in infrastructure in each respective neighborhood with the Crenshaw Line in Leimert Park and the LA River project near Atwater Village, we would like to understand if this increases pressures to densify. With the failure of housing density bills in the state of California, we want to explore how single family housing can be a upzoned and used for affordable housing._

In comparing these two neighborhoods, we are interested in what can be learned about the motivations for housing density in communities that are predominantly zoned for single family housing. Housing density bills keep failing at the state level, yet the housing pressure continues to mount.: 

* _**How are urban single family neighborhoods evolving as the housing affordability crisis deepens?**_

* _**Are neighborhoods with different racial characteristics evolving differently?**_

* _**What does density look like in predominantly single family neighborhoods?**_

* _**Given the incentives that accessory dwelling unit (ADU) bills and transit oriented communities (TOC) policies provide -- have these affected density in the neighborhoods of Leimert Park and Atwater Village? Have these upzoning efforts resulted in housing getting built? Where is housing needed where it is still being refused?**_

* _**If targeting upzoning is being employed as a means of densification and offered as a solution to the housing problem, how well is this approach working?**_ 

## Why are we interested in this research?
* Los Angeles suffers from a housing affordability crisis. Nearly half of occupied housing units in the state of California are rented, and more than half those households spend over 30% of their income on housing, which HUD defines as cost-burdened. Combining rentals and owned properties, 48.6% of California’s housing units – over 6.3 million of them – are a cost burden to their occupants. Governor Newsom has emphasized housing affordability as an executive priority and planned to build 3.5 million housing units by 2025, which would have necessitated building 500,000 new units per year from his inauguration.  However, local control over zoning interfered with this goal, and 2019 actually saw a 5.5% decline in total housing starts (109,900).
* American exclusionary zoning was created to enforce the color line between middle-class white Americans and everyone else, and over a hundred years of planning has reinforced single-family housing as the __“highest and best use”__ of land, resulting in artificially inflated housing values and severely limited development. Over two-thirds of California municipalities have set more than half their land for single family housing and less than a quarter for multifamily housing  due to zoning restrictions. This has resulted in massive spatial inequality and concentrations of either poverty or prosperity across the state.
* Exclusionary zoning is starting to attract serious critique from the planning profession and from progressive policymakers, with the State of Oregon and the city of Minneapolis both eliminating the R1 (Single-Family-only) zone entirely. Other jurisdictions have responded to the housing affordability crisis with a more targeted upzoning strategy, selecting specific areas to allow increased density. 

## Spatial Scope

_We are interested in Atwater Village, in Northeast Los Angeles, and Leimert Park in South Los Angeles. As California intends to increase its housing production, these locations can provide unique perspectives and make a case for density in the state. Broadly, we are interested in using these areas as case studies to look at housing pressures and understand how these pressures motivate upzoning in the urban and suburban context. Further, can both of these jurisdictions use density as a means to create more opportunities for affordable housing?_


## Description of Data Sources

#### LA City Data: New Residential Building Permits over 100k
_The Department of Building and Safety issues permits for the construction, remodeling, and repair of buildings and structures in the City of Los Angeles. Permits are categorized into building permits, electrical permits, and mechanical permits (which include plumbing, HVAC systems, fire sprinklers, elevators, and pressure vessels). Depending on the complexity of a project, a permit may be issued the same day with Express Permit or e-Permit ("No Plan Check" category), or a permit may require that the plans be reviewed ("Plan Check" category) by a Building and Safety Plan Check personnel.We will filter out construction permits for new housing units within the neighborhoods of Leimert Park and Atwater Village._

#### American Community Survey (ACS) Census Data: SELECTED HOUSING CHARACTERISTICS
_Will utilize ACS information to make connections of affordability and housing production in the State of California._

## Scope of Work

_Our intended analysis will create connections between racialized housing policies like redlining and the power of single family zoning. Utilizing permit data will demonstrate where construction in happening in Los Angeles and Riverside and point to where housing production (density) has stagnated. We intend to explore if the same locations that enforced redlining are also those areas most resistant to change and density. Utilizing the American Community Survey data will further reveal tresholds of affordability, homeownership, and overcrowding._

**Other considerations for visualizations:** 
* Ellis act evictions (may measure gentrification better than just housing pressure) [Anti eviction mapping project] 
* Rent increases as a heat map
* Overcrowding as proxy for housing pressure (ACS)
* Need two maps from two different years to overlay and find the discrepancies in zoning for each jurisdiction


## Conclusion

_We want to know if the rhetoric around existing efforts at targeted upzoning pattern has resulted in actual housing for low-income residents by understanding how the state of California can target single family zoning to increase density. We expect to reveal that single family neighborhoods that have not increased their density are also those that historically enforced redlining policies. We also hope to make the case that desnsity in urban and suburban neighborhoods is equally needed._

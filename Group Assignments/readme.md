# Understanding Density and Affordability
_Alejandro Gonzalez and Mike Van Gorder_
<h3> Research Question Introduction
   <h6>State and Historical Context of SFH Dominance: What places have changed from SFH to R3-R5 and why? Did that upzoning result in housing getting built? Where is housing needed where it is still being refused?
   <h6> *California suffers from a housing affordability crisis. Nearly half of occupied housing units in the state are rented, and more than half those households spend over 30% of their income on housing, which HUD defines as cost-burdened. Combining rentals and owned properties, 48.6% of California’s housing units – over 6.3 million of them – are a cost burden to their occupants. Governor Newsom has emphasized housing affordability as an executive priority and planned to build 3.5 million housing units by 2025, which would have necessitated building 500,000 new units per year from his inauguration.  However, local control over zoning interfered with this goal, and 2019 actually saw a 5.5% decline in total housing starts (109,900).

# Understanding Density and Affordability in the City of Los Angeles & Unincorporated Riverside County 
_Alejandro Gonzalez and Michael Van Gorder, UP206_
## Research Question Introduction: Local and Historical Context of Single Family Housing Dominance

_Looking at housing data in the urban context of the City of Los Angeles, and the suburban context in Unincorporated Riverside County -- we are interested in what can be learned about the motivations for housing density in communities that are predominantly zoned for single family housing. With the failure of housing density bills in the state of California, we want to explore how single family housing can be a upzoned and used for affordable housing._

* _**What places have changed from Single Family Housing only (R1) to R3-R5 and why? Did that upzoning result in housing getting built? Where is housing needed where it is still being refused?**_

* _**If targeting upzoning is being employed as a means of densification and offered as a solution to the housing problem, how well is this approach working?**_ 

## Why are we interested in this research?
* California suffers from a housing affordability crisis. Nearly half of occupied housing units in the state are rented, and more than half those households spend over 30% of their income on housing, which HUD defines as cost-burdened. Combining rentals and owned properties, 48.6% of California’s housing units – over 6.3 million of them – are a cost burden to their occupants. Governor Newsom has emphasized housing affordability as an executive priority and planned to build 3.5 million housing units by 2025, which would have necessitated building 500,000 new units per year from his inauguration.  However, local control over zoning interfered with this goal, and 2019 actually saw a 5.5% decline in total housing starts (109,900).
* American exclusionary zoning was created to enforce the color line between middle-class white Americans and everyone else, and over a hundred years of planning has reinforced single-family housing as the __“highest and best use”__ of land, resulting in artificially inflated housing values and severely limited development. Over two-thirds of California municipalities have set more than half their land for single family housing and less than a quarter for multifamily housing  due to zoning restrictions. This has resulted in massive spatial inequality and concentrations of either poverty or prosperity across the state.
* Exclusionary zoning is starting to attract serious critique from the planning profession and from progressive policymakers, with the State of Oregon and the city of Minneapolis both eliminating the R1 (Single-Family-only) zone entirely. Other jurisdictions have responded to the housing affordability crisis with a more targeted upzoning strategy, selecting specific areas to allow increased density. 

## Spatial Scope

_We are interested in the spatial scope of the City of Los Angeles and Unincorporated Riverside County. Given their varying local contexts as urban and suburban areas, respectively, we are interested in using these areas as case studies as they are both looking for creative solutions to densify. As California intends to increase its housing production, these locations can provide unique perspectives and make a case for density in the state. Broadly, we are interested in using these areas as case studies to look at housing pressures and understand how these pressures motivate upzoning in the urban and suburban context. Further, can both of these jusrisdictions use density as a means to create more opportunities for affordable housing?_


## Description of Data Sources

#### LA City Data: New Residential Building Permits over 100k
_The Department of Building and Safety issues permits for the construction, remodeling, and repair of buildings and structures in the City of Los Angeles. Permits are categorized into building permits, electrical permits, and mechanical permits (which include plumbing, HVAC systems, fire sprinklers, elevators, and pressure vessels). Depending on the complexity of a project, a permit may be issued the same day with Express Permit or e-Permit ("No Plan Check" category), or a permit may require that the plans be reviewed ("Plan Check" category) by a Building and Safety Plan Check personnel._

#### Riverside County Mapping Portal: Assessor PropertyCharacteristics Table
_Interested in utilizing shapefiles of the Regional Housing Needs Assessment (RHNA) neighborhoods, areas being upzoned, and any breakdown that might demonstrate where accessory dwelling unit (ADU) production is taking place._

#### American Community Survey (ACS) Census Data: SELECTED HOUSING CHARACTERISTICS
_Will utilize ACS information to make connections of affordability and housing production in the State of California._

* (https://data.census.gov/cedsci/table?g=0400000US06_1600000US0644000&d=ACS%205-Year%20Estimates%20Data%20Profiles&tid=ACSDP5Y2018.DP04) 

### Scope of Work

_Our intended analysis will create connections between racialized housing policies like redlining and the power of single family zoning. Utilizing permit data will demonstrate where construction in happening in Los Angeles and Riverside and point to where housing production (density) has stagnated. We intend to explore if the same locations that enforced redlining are also those areas most resistant to change and density. Utilizing the American Community Survey data will further reveal tresholds of affordability, homeownership, and overcrowding._

**Other considerations for visualizations:** 
* Ellis act evictions (may measure gentrification better than just housing pressure) [Anti eviction mapping project] 
* Rent increases as a heat map
* Overcrowding as proxy for housing pressure (ACS)
* Need two maps from two different years to overlay and find the discrepancies in zoning for each jurisdiction


### Conclusion

_We want to know if the rhetoric around existing efforts at targeted upzoning pattern has resulted in actual housing for low-income residents by understanding how the state of California can target single family zoning to increase density. We expect to reveal that single family neighborhoods that have not increased their density are also those that historically enforced redlining policies. We also hope to make the case that desnsity in urban and suburban neighborhoods is equally needed._
